G2P0 now 1 mother. Prenatal screens: O+, antibody negative, RPR NR, HBsAg negative, RI, GBS negative. Maternal h/o: asthma (meds: albuterol, flovent, flonase), depression (on Zoloft). Also reported to have received steroids for a bactrim rxn (? timing).\\n\\nThis pregancy IUI and complicated by PIH. Mother presented for induction. Delivery by cesarean section. Apgras 8,9. Aproximately 1 hour after delivery assessed by NNP for respiratory distress. Initial assessment reassuring. However, within next hour d/t peristence of symptoms infant was transferred to NICU.\\n\\nUpon arrival infant with retractions, poor aeration, and poor perfusion. Saturation poor in RA. Infant suctioned, given facial CPAP with some improvement. Negative transillumination for air leak. Placed on nasal prong CPAP 6.  CXR taken. IV placed and fluid bolus given for poor perfusion. Labs drawn and infant started on antibiotics.\\n\\nRemainder of exam - AFSF. CV RRR, no murmur, good peripheral pulses though pale with 3+ sec perfusion. Abd soft, +BS. GU nl male. Testes down bilat. Patent anus. No sacral anomalies.

However must also consider infection and/or RDS given marginal term dates.\\n\\n-- CPAP and provide FiO2 as needed. If inc distress consider blood gases and increase in support including ventilation and surfactant delivery\\n-- Antibiotics pending clinical course and bld cx results\\n-- NPO for now as he transitions; provide maintenance IVFs\\n-- Check lytes and bili at 24h\\n-- Keep family updated\\n\\nOB care: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14**]. Delivered by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 15**].\\nPedi care: [**Hospital 16**] Pediatrics.\\n\\n\\n Respiratory Care\\nPt admitted to NICU for respiratory distress. Placed on prong CPAP. Currently pt breathing comfortably on +5cmH2O, RA. bs clear, rr 30's. Plan to support as needed.\\n Admission Note\\nInfant is a former 37 [**4-23**] week male born to a 38yr old G1 P0->1 GBS neg mom.  Infant was born via c/s with apgars of 8 and 9.  See above note for further antepartum and delivery hx.  Infant was noted to have resp distress in L&D and was brought to NICU for eval.  Infant arrived to NICU at 1230 and was placed on warmer and central monitor.  Initially, infant was dusky and had poor perfusion.  See flowsheet for VS.  CXR done.  Rec'd 32cc NS bolus with improved perfusion.\\nResp:  Infant began receiving facial CPAP for O2 sats of 30's to 40's then was placed on prong CPAP 6 requiring 50% fiO2.  RR=30-60's.  LS diminished initially, but improved after being placed on CPAP.  Infant was able to quickly wean to RA then CPAP 5.\\nCV:  No murmur.  HR=140-150's.  BP stable.  See flowsheet.  Infant's color improving.\\nFEN:  WT=3160gms.  TF=60cc/k/day D10W.  NPO.  D/S = 86.  V&S.\\nID:  WBC=18.7 with 61N/0B.  Receiving ampi and gent.  Bld cx sent.\\nG&D:  Tone improved.
